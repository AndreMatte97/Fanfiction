# Fanfiction
Web Crawlers for https://efpfanfic.net/, a website containing user-generated fanfictions and original stories written in Italian. A corpus made up of fanfictions extracted from this portal has been analyzed in the Computational Linguistics study presented in http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2769/paper_52.pdf.

Please remember that the distribution of the material found on that website cannot be distributed without the author's consent, except for short quotes. This is why we deemed appropriate to only share the spiders employed to extract this data, instead of the whole corpus.

## Requisites
* Python installed on your machine (guaranteed functionality with Python 3.6.4)
* The Python module Scrapy (https://scrapy.org/, or simply `pip install scrapy`)
* An account on EFP: the spiders need you username and password to log in on the website. This is because stories containing mature content are hidden unless you are logged in (and have declared to be at least 18 years old). To register, go at: https://efpfanfic.net/newaccount.php
